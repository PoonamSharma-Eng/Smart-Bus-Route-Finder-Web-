**Smart Bus Route Finder**

I built this project to showcase how JavaScript can be used to filter data in real-time. It's a small part of my vision for a Smart Bus System.

**How it works:**

**Search Logic:** As you type in the destination, the app instantly filters the available bus routes.

**Modern UI:** I used CSS to give it a clean, card-based look that feels like a real mobile app.

**No Refresh:** The search happens instantly without the page reloading, thanks to JavaScript.

**Why this is powerful:**

Even though the code is simple, it uses the same "Filter" logic found in major e-commerce and navigation websites.

**Running the project:**

Simply open index.html in your browser and start typing a destination like "Airport" or "College".
